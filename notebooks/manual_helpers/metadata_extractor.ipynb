Dist depicts areas that have experienced a disturbance within a given year of 4.5 hectares (11 acres) or larger, along with cause and severity. Information sources include national fire mapping programs such as Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS), Burned Area Reflectance Classification (BARC), and Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Condition after Wildfire (RAVG), local user/agency contributed data (LF Events Geodatabase), and remotely sensed Landsat imagery. Composite Landsat image pairs from the current year, prior year, and following year are spectrally compared to determine where change occurred and its corresponding severity. Additionally, vegetation indices (Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index [NDVI] and Normalized Burn Ratio [NBR]) serve as inputs into the Multi-Index Integrated Change Algorithm (MIICA) (Jin et al. 2013); MIICA outputs and differenced products (e.g., dNDVI and dNBR) are used to locate change.  Predictive modeling based on the previous 10 years of disturbance data provides an additional dataset useful for locating disturbance.  Image analysts use the aforementioned datasets separately or in combination to isolate true change from false change (e.g., change caused by stark differences in phenology rather than a true disturbance event). The accuracy of the final product is often related to the quality of the Landsat image composite.  Areas with persistent cloud cover are particularly challenging (e.g., the northeast US). Fire caused disturbances sourced from MTBS may contain data gaps where clouds, smoke, water or Landsat Seven SLC-off stripes exist. Models trained from pre-fire and post-fire Landsat data are used to fill the gaps. The result is continuous severity and extent information for all MTBS fire disturbances. MTBS pixels derived from gap filling techniques, such as modeling, are noted as such in their corresponding attribute table. Smaller fires that do not meet the size criteria set forth by MTBS) may be attributed as a Burned Area Essential Climate Variable (BAECV), which are only produced for the lower 48 states. Causality and severity information assigned to a disturbance are prioritized by source, with the highest priorities reserved for fire mapping programs (MTBS, BARC and RAVG) followed by user-contributed events contained in the LF Events Geodatabase, and lastly, Landsat image based change.\", 'purpose': 'LF 2016 Remap (LF Remap) is a comprehensive mapping effort that uses recent data to create a new base map product suite that better represents contemporary conditions.
